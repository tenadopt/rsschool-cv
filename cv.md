Summary

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with experience in crafting responsive,
user-centric web applications. My journey in web development has equipped me
with solid expertise in modern technologies like JavaScript, React, Redux, and
TypeScript. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and have a strong
focus on delivering high-quality solutions, employing tools like Jest, ESLint,
and stylelint to ensure robustness and consistency.

What excites me about software development is the continuous learning journey
it demands. I thrive in environments where I can learn independently, pick up
new technologies, and adapt quickly. I believe that my varied experience—from
managing projects and leading sales initiatives to working on web development
projects—gives me a unique perspective in understanding both technical
requirements and user needs.

English

I have an advanced level of English (C1) and have continually developed my language skills through both
formal and practical experiences. I completed a C1 Business English course at Streamline Language School,
which spanned from September 2023 to June 2024. This course emphasized professional communication,
presentation skills, and business terminology, equipping me with a strong foundation in workplace English.

In addition, my experience working in international teams has provided me with regular, practical use of English.
I frequently communicate with colleagues, clients, and collaborators in English, honing my skills in written and
verbal communication in real-world scenarios. This ongoing exposure has allowed me to build confidence, fluency,
and an understanding of cultural nuances, especially in professional settings.
